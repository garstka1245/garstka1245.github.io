		<p>Details:<br>
			&emsp;This was a project for my class "Object Oriented Game Development" where over the course of 12 weeks we individually tried to recreate Centipede, 
			a 1980's arcade game featuring various critters moving around attacking the player, and the ability to shoot at them to accumulate points.
			This was programmed in C++ using SFML for window, sprite, and sound capabilities, and our teacher's light game engine,
			giving us very basic tools including animated sprites, game loop with scene structure (an entry point to start and end the game),
			and game objects with an update, draw, and collide methods. The rest was coded by us and includes 132 files and 3868 lines of code
			in the end, my biggest single project at the time. The most important part was we learned and implemented the use of various 
			"Design Patterns" which made our code much more adaptable to future changes, with important mechanics seperated out so changing one feature
			would not break something coded a while ago, it also often makes the logic more efficient. I wouldn't say all the code is outstanding but I learned a lot on this project, and it forms the way I would go about making a large scale project.
